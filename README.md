# HackingHeist-SereneSpace
Serene space is a web application made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript<br>
The main idea behind this website is to compile some well researched resources, websites and NGO's working towards mental health, its cure, and to make it vocal on a global level.<br><br>
<b>Target audience -</b><br>
People who are struggling to take the first step or are unaware of how to start and where to approach during a time of crisis can find this website very useful.<br>
This would also serve as a help for those who are looking after a loved one and want to help them out by some means.<br>
The website also carefully cumulates some blogs from all over the internet to calm you down, seek hope and positivity and gain some insights and information from people who are 
either well iformed about it or those who have been there in this situation.<br>
Users can also contact us through the website in case on any doubts or queries and we would be happy to help.<br><br>
<b>Let us not forget that mental illness is real and can happen to anyone and seeking help, raising awareness and being hopeful is what will help you emerge stronger.</b>
<br><br>
<b>Repository info-</b><br>
The repository has three files and an image folder each corresponding to HTML, CSS and JavaScript files along with an image folder that contains all the images that have been used.<br><br>
